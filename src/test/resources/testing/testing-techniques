Testing Techniques

Black-Box Testing
Definition: Focuses on input and output without knowledge of the internal code.
Techniques:
Equivalence Partitioning: Divides inputs into valid and invalid partitions.
Boundary Value Analysis (BVA): Tests edge cases like maximum, minimum, and just-out-of-bounds values.
Decision Table Testing: Tests multiple conditions and their expected outcomes.
State Transition Testing: Tests how the application behaves in different states.

White-Box Testing
Definition: Involves examining the internal structure of the code.
Techniques:
Statement Coverage: Ensures every line of code is executed.
Branch Coverage: Ensures every branch (e.g., if and else statements) is executed.
Path Coverage: Tests all possible paths in the program.
Loop Testing: Specifically tests loops for different cases (0 iterations, 1 iteration, multiple iterations).

Gray-Box Testing
Definition: Combines black-box and white-box testing techniques.
Application: Useful for end-to-end testing and testing data flow across the application.
Example: Testing a shopping cart system with knowledge of how the database stores cart items.

Manual Testing
Definition: Testing without automation tools, simulating real user interactions.
Use Case: Especially useful for usability, exploratory, and ad-hoc testing.

Automated Testing
Definition: Uses scripts and tools to perform tests automatically.
Use Case: Best for regression, load, and performance testing due to speed and efficiency.
Tools: Selenium, TestNG, JUnit, Appium.

Non-Functional Testing Techniques
Load Testing: Measures performance under expected user load.
Stress Testing: Tests the systemâ€™s behavior under extreme load conditions.
Scalability Testing: Ensures the application can scale up as needed.
Usability Testing: Tests user-friendliness.
Reliability Testing: Ensures the application performs consistently over time.
Ad-hoc Testing

Definition: Informal testing without a plan, often done to catch unforeseen bugs.
Objective: Quickly identify and fix issues based on intuition and experience.
Example: Testing parts of a new feature by randomly navigating through the UI.
End-to-End Testing

Definition: Tests the complete application flow from start to finish.
Objective: Validate entire workflows and integrations.
Example: For an e-commerce site, testing the entire process of searching for a product, adding it to the cart, checking out, and receiving an order confirmation.
