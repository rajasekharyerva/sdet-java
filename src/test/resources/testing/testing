Q 1 - What are un-reproducible bugs?
Ans: The following kind of bugs can be categorised as un-reproducible bugs:
Defects that surface due to issues of low memory.
↳ Errors or bugs that arise due to addresses pointing to memory locations that do not exist.
↳ Race conditions are error scenarios that occur when the time of execution of one event impacts another event executing in a sequence.

Q 2 - What is a critical bug?
Ans: A critical bug is a bug that impacts a major functionality of the given application.
This means affecting a large area of the functionality or breaking any functionality and there is no other method to overcome this problem.
The application cannot be delivered to the end user unless the critical bug is fixed.

Q 3 - How will you determine when to stop testing?
Ans: It can be hard to know when to stop testing.
Many modern software applications are so complicated and run in such a relaxed environment that thorough testing is impossible.
The following are some regular criteria to consider when considering when to end testing:
↳ Deadlines are very important (release deadlines, testing deadlines, etc.)
↳ Completed test cases with a certain percentage of passing
↳ When the test budget runs out
↳ When the coverage of code, functionality, or requirements arrives at a certain point, it is said to be complete
↳ When the bug rate drops below a specific threshold
↳ When the beta or alpha testing stage is over

Q 4 - What are the best software quality practices as per your work experience?
Ans: These are some best practices I usually follow to deliver a high-quality product and effectively perform my QA roles and responsibilities in software testing
↳ Review the requirements in depth before you start with the development
↳ Write comprehensive test cases as required
↳ Perform session-based testing, then risk-based testing
↳ Set the priority for bugs based on usage
↳ Run a regression cycle
↳ Perform sanity tests on pre-prod
↳ Focus on QA test reports

Q 5 - Describe the defect cycle steps
Ans: As a candidate, you should have knowledge of the bug cycle, which typically follows these steps:
↳ Defect discovery: A defect is discovered during testing or by a customer.
↳ Defect reporting: The tester reports the defect along with a detailed description and steps to reproduce it.
↳ Defect prioritisation: The defect is prioritised based on its severity and impact on the product.
↳ Defect assignment: The defect is assigned to a developer to investigate and fix.
↳ Defect fixing: The developer fixes the defect and verifies the fix.
↳ Defect Validation: The tester validates that the defect has been fixed and closes.
↳ Defect closure: The defect is closed after being fixed and validated.
