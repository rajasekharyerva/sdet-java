Example of a Test Strategy for an E-commerce Web Application
Imagine weâ€™re creating a test strategy for an e-commerce platform, focusing on the entire system's stability and performance during peak shopping times, like a Black Friday sale.

Test Strategy Document
Objective:

The goal is to ensure that the e-commerce application functions correctly under normal and high load conditions, providing a seamless experience to users for browsing, purchasing, and processing orders.
Scope:

This strategy covers all key areas, including user registration, login, product search, cart management, checkout, and payment.
Focus on both functional (correctness of features) and non-functional (performance, security) testing.
Test Levels:

Unit Testing: Conducted by developers to ensure that individual components (e.g., search functionality) work as expected.
Integration Testing: Ensures different modules work together, such as adding an item to the cart and verifying it displays correctly.
System Testing: Verifies the end-to-end workflow of purchasing, from browsing products to receiving an order confirmation.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Final testing by stakeholders or end-users to validate the functionality and usability.
Testing Types:

Functional Testing: Ensures that each feature functions according to requirements (e.g., payment gateway processes all payment types).
Performance Testing: Includes load testing and stress testing to assess how the system performs under high user load.
Security Testing: Identifies any vulnerabilities, such as data breaches during checkout or sensitive information storage.
Test Environment:

Test environments must mimic production as closely as possible, including data sets and configurations that replicate high traffic.
Risk Analysis:

Risk: Unavailability of payment gateways during peak hours.
Mitigation: Conduct load testing on the payment gateway and have fallback systems in place.
Automation Strategy:

Automate repetitive regression tests for login, cart, and checkout features using tools like Selenium.
Performance testing with JMeter for load simulation.
Defect Management:

Track defects in JIRA, using priority levels: Critical, High, Medium, and Low.
Tools:

Functional Testing: Selenium WebDriver
Performance Testing: Apache JMeter
Defect Tracking: JIRA
Roles and Responsibilities:

Test Manager: Oversees the entire testing strategy.
QA Engineers: Write and execute test cases.
Developers: Perform unit testing.
