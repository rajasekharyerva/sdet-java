Example of a Test Plan for the Checkout Feature
A Test Plan for the checkout feature of the same e-commerce application will be more specific, detailing exactly what needs to be tested and how.

Test Plan Document
Test Plan ID:

TP-CH001
Overview:
This test plan covers functional, usability, and security testing of the checkout process, ensuring users can reliably purchase items.

Scope of Testing:
In-Scope: Checkout workflow, payment processing, address validation, discount/coupon application.
Out-of-Scope: Registration and login functionality (covered in separate test plans).

Test Objectives:
Verify that users can successfully complete checkout with all payment options (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
Confirm that discounts and promotions are correctly applied.
Ensure that user data is securely handled during checkout.

Assumptions and Dependencies:
Assumes that the payment gateway is integrated and available.
Depends on the inventory system for real-time stock updates.

Entry and Exit Criteria:
Entry Criteria: The checkout feature is deployed to the test environment and passes initial smoke tests.
Exit Criteria: 95% of all test cases pass, with no critical or high-severity defects.

Test Deliverables:
Test cases, test data, defect reports, and a final test summary report.

Test Environment Requirements:
Staging environment with real payment gateway sandbox.
Necessary test data for different payment types and scenarios (e.g., invalid card details, out-of-stock items).

Test Schedule:
Test Case Creation: March 1 - March 5
Test Execution: March 6 - March 10
Defect Triage and Fixes: March 11 - March 15

Resource Planning:
QA Engineers: Responsible for writing and executing test cases.
Developers: Address any defects identified in testing.

Risks and Mitigations:
Risk: Payment gateway downtime could impact test execution.
Mitigation: Use a payment gateway mock for testing in case the real gateway is down.

Approach and Execution:
Functional Testing: Execute test cases for each payment method.
Security Testing: Conduct tests to verify that sensitive user data (e.g., credit card info) is encrypted.
Usability Testing: Verify that the checkout process is user-friendly.

Approval and Sign-Off:
Test Lead: Signs off on the test plan after review with stakeholders.
