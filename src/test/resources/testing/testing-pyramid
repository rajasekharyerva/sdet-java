## Testing Pyramid

The **Testing Pyramid** is a concept that promotes a balanced approach to testing with three main levels:

1. **Unit Tests** (Base of the Pyramid)
   - Focus on testing individual functions or methods in isolation.
   - Fast, numerous, and ensure core logic works as expected.
   - Example tools: JUnit, Mocha, Jasmine.

2. **Integration Tests** (Middle of the Pyramid)
   - Test interactions between different components or external services.
   - Slower than unit tests but essential for verifying the integration of modules.
   - Example tools: Postman, RestAssured.

3. **End-to-End Tests** (Top of the Pyramid)
   - Simulate real user scenarios, testing the entire application flow.
   - Slowest tests, covering critical user paths.
   - Example tools: Selenium, Cypress.

### Benefits
- **Efficiency**: More unit tests lead to faster feedback and lower cost.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch issues at the unit test level.
- **Maintainable**: Avoid over-relying on end-to-end tests, keeping them minimal and effective.

By following the pyramid structure, teams can ensure high-quality software with balanced and efficient test coverage.
