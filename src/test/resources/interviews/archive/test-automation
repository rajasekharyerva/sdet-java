1. How do you handle a stale element in Selenium?
- > Use a try-catch block to catch StaleElementReferenceException and re-locate the element.

2. Why might Selenium’s hover or click not work on an element, and how do you resolve it?
- >Possible reasons: dynamic content or overlays.
    Solutions: use JavaScriptExecutor or scroll the element into view.

6. What are the SOLID principles in software design?
- >Key OOP principles for better code: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.

7. How do you find the minimum deletions to make letter frequencies unique in a string?
- >Count letter frequencies and adjust them to ensure uniqueness with minimal deletions.

8. What are essential credit card test cases for validations?
- >Check number length, format, and type-specific rules.

3. How do you reverse a string without reversing special characters?
- >Traverse from both ends, swapping only alphabetic characters while skipping special characters.

What challenges might a team face when transitioning from a traditional release model to a Continuous Deployment pipeline, and how would you address them?

1. How do deployment pipelines integrate security practices (DevSecOps), and what measures would you implement to ensure that security is not compromised during Continuous Deployment?
2. What considerations should be taken when implementing a multi-region deployment strategy to ensure availability and minimise latency?
3. Imagine a scenario where a deployment to production fails after 75% of a Rolling Deployment has been completed.
What strategies would you employ to minimise service disruptions and revert to the previous stable version?
4. How would you implement environment-specific configurations securely in a CD pipeline to prevent exposure of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database passwords)?
5. Explain how you would use feature flags in conjunction with Continuous Deployment to manage the release of new features without impacting the entire user base.
6. Circle CI users sometimes encounter parallel execution challenges during large-scale deployments.
How would you structure a Circle CI pipeline to ensure efficient, synchronised multi-environment deployments?
7. How do you implement a robust monitoring system in a Jenkins or Circle CI pipeline to automatically halt deployments if predefined metrics (e.g., error rates, response times) exceed acceptable thresholds?
8. How would you design a CD pipeline for a microservices architecture to ensure that interdependencies between services are handled properly during deployment?
9. How would you use container orchestration tools (like Kubernetes) in conjunction with Jenkins or Circle CI to achieve zero-downtime deployments for a high-traffic web service?

4. How do you find k closest values to a target in a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
- >Use in-order traversal and a min-heap or sliding window for efficiency.

5. What’s the best way to sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s?
- >Apply the Dutch National Flag algorithm for linear-time sorting.

Challenges or Production issues
-------------------------------
timeout error - implementation - retry mechanism, specific builder cases implementation not be retry
retry creates multiple records for same- transient error, udm, css, bc
v1, v2 config for DLQ implementations - lost track of it
fetch updates from azure databricks, Hybris - few attributes from ADB, Hybris- It's creating new records - initially, create only if present
variants a-b-c-d size, color, fit, style- user able access from direct child if parent is soft delete via api even parent/child broken
product categories, l1,l2,l3,l4. parts-machines-agriculture-spare parts dropdown missing due to data issue.
category updates from back end independently / along with product - category mapping
1. categories l1, l2, l3, l4
2. product translations updates from backend
3. FBT, Alternates/Substitutes
4. v1, v2 - udm address event builder (feature flag not enabled data going to v1)
address update, old new address - issue, updated with some other user, null
images missing, wrong images(x-lower)
roll back scenarios ui - (bc) - css, udm
language fall backs - en-US, en-FR, en-CA - English, French, fr-EN
en-FR - en-CA ? fr-CA
alerts - configs
topics, qlik tasks, update fields to track
change mask - not to updates again - for untracked fields
if product active only update else skip, when it active update all fields/soft delete
synchronization issues - full synchronization period- data load validations/errors
config maps for each environment updated & committed
bypass run
dry run - in staging env, tagging -  enforcing testing pro-prod or staging env
auto conversions - based on regions, en-US lb, in, cm, kgs
