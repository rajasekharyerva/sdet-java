1. Reverse a String
 - Practice reversing a string using loops or StringBuilder.

2. Check for Palindrome
 - Write code to check if a string reads the same forwards and backwards.

3. Fibonacci Series
 - Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a certain point using loops.

4. Factorial of a Number
 - Implement both iterative and recursive methods to find factorial.

5. Prime Number Check
 - Learn how to check if a number is prime using simple logic.

6. Count Vowels and Consonants
 - Write a program to count vowels and consonants in a string.

7. Sort an Array
 - Practice collections.sorting collections.arrays using built-in methods and manual techniques like bubble or selection sort.
Arrays.sort(arr);

8. Find Largest Element in an Array
 - Learn to iterate through collections.arrays to find the largest number.

9. Remove Duplicates from an Array
 - Use sets or other methods to remove duplicates from collections.arrays.

10. Check for Anagram
 - Test two strings to see if they're anagrams by collections.sorting or using character counts.

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:
- Focus on writing clean, efficient, and readable code.
- Use Stream API for modern, simplified solutions.
- Master data structures like collections.arrays, lists, and sets.
- Understand basic algorithms like collections.sorting, searching, and recursion.
