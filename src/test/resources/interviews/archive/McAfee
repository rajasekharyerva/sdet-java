Round 1:
1. Write a program to find a prime number in a list.
2. Write a program to find the largest number in a list.
3. Write a program to reverse a number and string without using pre-built methods.
4. What is meant by a RESTful API?
And some questions related to HTTP status codes.

Round 2:
1. Implement a sample backend application with some sample data where you need to update the data as attached in the chat.
2. Write an optimized SQL query to fetch the third-largest high-salaried person. You need to create a table, insert sample data, and query to fetch it.
3. Write a program to remove duplicates from a list.
One more coding question, but I'm not getting it.

Round 3:
Past work experience, project-related questions, machine learning concepts, writing a sample test case based on the scenario, and scenario-based questions.
