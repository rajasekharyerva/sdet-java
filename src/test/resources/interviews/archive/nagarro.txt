1. What is the difference b/w background and before annotation?
1.1 Explain testng annotations and how will we use annotation in our framework
    TestNG annotations are used to control the flow of test methods and provide additional information about the test methods.
    TestNG annotations are used to mark methods as test methods, setup methods, teardown methods, etc.
    Annotations like @Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, @BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite are commonly used in TestNG framework.
    Annotations help in organizing and prioritizing test methods, setting dependencies between test methods, and controlling the execution flow of tests.
2. How can we verify dynamic schema of a response?
    // Validate the response JSON against the schema
    response.then().body(matchesJsonSchemaInClasspath("responseSchema.json"));
3. How can we use one scenario's output in another scenario's input?
    Data sharing: Achieved via ScenarioContext, Singletons, Shared Storage, or global variables within hooks or step definitions.
4. What is priority in testNG?

6. Oops concepts, live coding, programming, testing types.
    Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
        Overriding:
        Overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.
        Overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass
        It is used in automation frameworks to customize or extend the functionality of existing methods or classes
        In automation testing, overriding can be used to modify the behavior of test methods inherited from a base test class
7. Difference b/w Hashmap vs HashTable and which one is faster on basis of performance!
    HashMap allows null values and keys, while HashTable does not. HashMap is not synchronized, making it faster in performance compared to HashTable.
    HashMap allows null values and keys, while HashTable does not.
    HashMap is not synchronized, making it faster in performance compared to HashTable.
    HashMap is preferred for non-thread-safe applications, while HashTable is preferred for thread-safe applications.
8. Current roles and responsibilities ?
9. Dynamic web tables ? Or dynamic elements ?
    Sometimes IDs and classes of the web element keep changing.
    Such web elements are called Dynamic web elements.
    These are database based elements and its values get refreshed everytime the database gets updated.

19. What is POM ? Why we need !
    POM stands for Page Object Model. It is a design pattern used in test automation to create reusable and maintainable code.
    POM helps in separating the test scripts from the web elements, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.
    It improves code reusability by creating separate classes for each web page, containing all the elements and actions related to that page.
    POM reduces code duplication and enhances test script readability.
    It allows for easier maintenance and updates as any changes in the UI can be made in the Page Object class without affecting the test scripts.
    Example: Creating a LoginPage class with methods to interact with login form elements like username, password, and login button.
20. Why Stale Element Reference Exception!
    Stale Element Reference Exception occurs when an element is no longer attached to the DOM.
    Occurs when an element is located in the DOM, but later becomes detached or deleted
    Common in dynamic web applications where elements are frequently changing
    Can be resolved by re-locating the element before interacting with it
21. Diff between Collection VS Collections
    Collection is an interface in Java that represents a group of objects, while Collections is a utility class in Java that contains static methods for operating on collections.
    Collection is an interface in Java, while Collections is a utility class.
    Collection is used to represent a group of objects, while Collections is used for operations on collections like sorting, searching, etc.
    Example: List is a Collection interface, while Collections.sort() is a method in the Collections class.

27. Explain rest assured and write a code for post and verify the response
    Rest Assured is a Java library for testing RESTful APIs. It simplifies API testing by providing a fluent interface to make HTTP requests and validate responses.
    Rest Assured is commonly used in API automation testing to validate the functionality of RESTful APIs.
    It allows testers to easily make HTTP requests, set headers, parameters, and body, and validate the response.
    Here is an example code snippet for posting data and verifying the response using Rest Assured:
    given()
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    .body("{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 30 }")
    .when().post("https://api.example.com/users")
    .then()
    .assertThat()
    .statusCode(201)
    .and()
    .body("name", equalTo("John Doe"))
