🔗 Interview Preparation Series: Advanced QA and Automation Testing Questions 🔗
Let’s dive deeper into concepts that test not just your knowledge but also your problem-solving abilities.
💡 Here's the next set of questions to help you ace your QA interviews:
Coding Questions
1️⃣ Write a program to find the missing number in an array of integers from 1 to n.
2️⃣ How would you find the intersection of two collections.arrays in Java?
3️⃣ Write a code snippet to implement a binary search algorithm.
4️⃣ Develop logic to check whether a number is prime or not.
5️⃣ How would you write a program to count occurrences of a character in a string?
6️⃣ Implement a program to find the longest substring without repeating characters.
7️⃣ Create logic for validating whether a string contains balanced parentheses.
8️⃣ Write a program to simulate a simple collections.queue using stacks.

Scenario-Based Questions
🔍 Agile Methodology: How would you estimate testing tasks during sprint planning for a complex feature?
🔍 Bug Tracking: A bug is not reproducible in the developer's environment but exists in production. How would you approach this?
🔍 Test Automation Framework: What factors would you consider when designing a framework for a large e-commerce website?
🔍 Database Testing: You are tasked with verifying data integrity for a financial application. What test cases would you create?
🔍 Security Testing: How would you test an application for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or XSS?
🔍 API Load Testing: How would you ensure an API can handle a high number of concurrent requests?
🔍 UI Testing: How would you verify color, font, and text consistency across different browsers?
🔍 CI/CD Pipeline: What steps would you take to integrate automated test scripts into a CI/CD pipeline?
💻 Pro Tip: For coding questions, focus on clarity and efficiency. For scenario-based questions, showcase your analytical skills and practical experience.
