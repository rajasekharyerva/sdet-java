🌟 Why Use static in Java?
In Java, static makes variables, methods, or inner classes belong to the class itself rather than any specific instance.
This can be especially valuable in test-driven environments common to SDET roles. Here’s how it’s useful:
Static Variables – Shared across all instances. Great for things like counters or shared resources across test classes. 🧮
Static Methods – Call these without needing an object! Ideal for utility methods, like reusable test data generators. 🔄
Static Blocks – Perfect for one-time setups like initializing constants or configuration details. ⚙️
Static Inner Classes – Can be used without an outer class instance, making them perfect for helper classes in test frameworks. 📂
