1. Given an unsorted array of integers, find the third largest number in the array.
If the array has less than three distinct numbers, return the largest number.
Example:
Input:
arr = [2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 6]
Output:
4
Explanation:
The sorted array in descending order is [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. The third largest number is 4.

2. Given an array of strings, group the strings that are anagrams of each other.
Example:
Input:
arr = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output:
[["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
Explanation:
The groups of anagrams are ["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], and ["bat"].

3. Given an array of integers, find the largest number that does not have any duplicates in the array.
Example:
Input:
arr = [4, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 8]
Output:
8
Explanation:
The unique numbers are [2, 7, 8], and the largest among them is 8.
