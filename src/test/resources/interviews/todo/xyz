- I see people earning ₹40-50 LPA preaching, "Don't work for money."
- I see millionaires in Koramangla with two BMWs in their garage lecturing about minimalism.
- I see IIT/IIM graduates claiming a degree is just a piece of paper.
- I see founders who refuse to give ESOPs declaring, "It's your company."

Realside:
-These ₹40-50 LPA people fight every year with their boss for a maximum hike.
-These millionaires will never take an Auto or take public transport.
-Most of these IIT/IIM people hardly recruit people from Tier-2 or Tier-3 colleges and keep the alumni circle tight.
-These type of Founders keeps giving hope of ESOPs just to retain employees.

Look guys all this advice is to keep most of us poor, ugly, and average.

The world is full of hypocrites selling half-truths to protect their advantage.

Stop taking wisdom on the fly.
