1. Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with a length of 3.
𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡: Use a sliding window technique with two pointers:

2. Write a function that, given a m x n matrix where each row and each column are sorted in ascending order, searches for a given integer target.
matrix = [
[1, 4, 7, 11],
[2, 5, 8, 12],
[3, 6, 9, 16],
[10, 13, 14, 17]
]
target = 5
Output: True
𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:
Start at the top right of the matrix.
If the current number equals the target, return True.
If the current number is greater than the target, move left.
If the current number is less than the target, move down.
Continue until you find the number or exit the matrix bounds.
