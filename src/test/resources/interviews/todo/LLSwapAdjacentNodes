𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Given a linked list, write a program to swap every two adjacent nodes and return the modified linked list.
You must solve this problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes, only the nodes themselves may be changed.

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:
Original list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
After swapping: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: You are given two APIs: one that provides real-time stock prices and another that provides historical stock prices.
Develop a system that validates the incoming real-time prices against historical data to detect anomalies or significant deviations.

Write a program to fetch data from both APIs, process and compare the prices, and identify outliers.
Implement a mechanism to flag or log the anomalies in real time.

𝐇𝐢𝐧𝐭:
-> Use statistical methods like z-score or standard deviation to determine significant deviations.
-> Consider edge cases such as missing data or API failures.
-> Use multi-threading or asynchronous calls to handle real-time data efficiently.
