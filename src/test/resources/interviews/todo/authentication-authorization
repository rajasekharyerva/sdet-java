1. 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐢𝐬: Authentication is verifying a user's or system's identity. It answers the question, "Who are you?"
2. 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬: This is typically done through usernames and passwords, biometric data (like fingerprints), or security tokens. For example, when you log in to your email, you enter your username and password to prove that you are the rightful owner of that account.

1. 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐢𝐬: Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What can you do?"
2. 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬: Once your identity is authenticated, the system checks if you have the necessary permissions to access certain resources or perform certain actions. For example, after logging in to your email, you might be authorized to read your inbox but not to change server settings.
3. 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: After swiping your ID card to enter your office (authentication), you might only have access to certain floors of the building. The access control system ensures that only authorized personnel can enter restricted areas. This is authorization.
