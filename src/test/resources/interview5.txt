Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective exception handling in your projects. Letâ€™s break it down!

ðŸ”‘ Key Differences-->
throw:
---------
Used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or a block of code.
Can only throw a single exception at a time.
Example Usage:

public void validateEmail(String email) {
 if (!email.contains("@")) {
 throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid email address!");
 }
}
In this example, if the email does not contain an '@', an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

throws:
---------
Declares that a method can throw one or more exceptions.
Used in method signatures to indicate potential exceptions that might occur.
Example Usage:

public void connectToDatabase() throws SQLException {
 // Code to establish a connection
 if (/* connection fails */) {
 throw new SQLException("Failed to connect to the database.");
 }
}
Here, the method connectToDatabase declares that it might throw a SQLException.
ðŸ“Š Real-time Examples: Verifying Cash Withdrawal
-----------------------------------------------------------
When withdrawing cash from an ATM, you could use:

public void withdrawCash(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
 if (amount > balance) {
 throw new InsufficientFundsException("Insufficient funds for this transaction.");
 }
 // Process withdrawal
}
This not only indicates that the method may fail but also clearly states why it might fail, enhancing clarity in exception handling.
By understanding and effectively utilizing throw and throws, you can write more robust and maintainable Java applications! ðŸ’ª
